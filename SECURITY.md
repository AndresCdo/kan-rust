# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and strive to ensure that the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) project is secure. We will actively address security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do the following:

1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose**: Do not file a public issue or pull request. Security vulnerabilities should not be discussed in public forums until they are resolved.
2. **Contact Us Privately**: Send a detailed email to the project maintainers at [AndresCdo](mailto:andres.felipe.caicedo.ultengo@outlook.com). Include the following information:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Potential impact and severity of the vulnerability.
   - Any potential fixes or suggestions for mitigating the issue.

## Handling of Security Vulnerabilities

Upon receiving a security report, we will:

1. **Acknowledge Receipt**: Confirm receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for addressing the issue.
2. **Investigate**: Investigate the vulnerability to verify its validity and determine the impact.
3. **Mitigation Plan**: Develop a plan to mitigate and fix the vulnerability.
4. **Patch and Release**: Apply the necessary patches and release a new version. We aim to release security fixes as quickly as possible.
5. **Public Disclosure**: After the patch is released, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability, including details and the steps taken to address it.

## Security Best Practices

We encourage users and contributors to follow these security best practices:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential security issues.
- **Testing**: Implement and run comprehensive tests to ensure code changes do not introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Design and implement features with the principle of least privilege in mind, limiting access and permissions as much as possible.
